Amputee Mental Health.

> Amputation presents multi-directional challenges. It affects function, sensation and body image. The psychological reactions vary greatly and depend on many factors and variable. In most cases, the predominant experience of the amputee is one of loss: not only the obvious loss of the limb but also resulting losses in function, self-image, career and relationships[1].

> Many of the psychological reactions may be transient, some are helpful and constructive, others less so, and a few may require further action (e.g. psychiatric assessment in the case of psychosis)[1].

> About â‰¥30% of amputees are troubled by depression[1][2]. Psychological morbidity, decreased self esteem, distorted body image, increased dependency and significant levels of social isolation are also observed in short and long-term follow up after amputation[3][4].(Emotional_and_Psychological_Reactions_to_Amputation [Accessed 24 Oct. 2021]).

Personality Style

> Individuals who are narcissistically invested in their physical appearance and power tend to react negatively to the loss of the limb. They see it as a major assault upon their dignity and self-worth. Conversely, dependent individuals may cherish the sick role and find in it welcome relief from pressure and responsibility[19].

> Those with a premorbid history of depression are more susceptible to dysphoria following amputation[24] The loss serves to crystallize notions of a basic defect, sometimes expressed in self-punishing behaviors[25].

> Timid and self-conscious individuals who are excessively concerned about their social standing are more likely to suffer psychologically from limb loss than are self-assured individuals[26].

> Unexpected reactions may arise from secondary gain. If disability results in improved financial or social status, psychological adjustment may be made easier, especially if those gains are not directly challenged[19].(Emotional_and_Psychological_Reactions_to_Amputation [Accessed 24 Oct. 2021]).

Fundamentals of Amputation Care and Prosthetics

MODERN PROSTHETIC TECHNOLOGY

> Technological explosion has accompanied the remarkable advances in
the philosophical care of those with amputations. Rudimentary suspension systems have given way to innovative suction based, individually constructed socket systems. These systems allow for decreased
pain, preservation of limb integrity, and functionality. Computer
technology has been applied to the fitting of socket systems as well
as to the successful replacement of missing joints. Computer assisted
knees have now become common technology, which allows for
better control, improved energy expenditure, and return to activities
prohibited by mechanical technology. The quest for a functional limb
has transformed to the quest for fully functioning bionic limbs.

Surgical Complications
> Those individuals who suffer pain, infection, and residual-limb revision tend to develop greater degrees of despair and withdrawal than those who do not.  A poorly performed amputation almost guarantees poor rehabilitation. While a well-performed amputation does not guarantee a successful rehabilitation outcome, it certainly makes successful rehabilitation more possible(Emotional_and_Psychological_Reactions_to_Amputation [Accessed 24 Oct. 2021]).

Prosthetic Rehabilitation
> The use of well-fitting prosthetic reduces pain and  post-amputation depression[5]. Conversely, if the prosthetic application is absent or delayed, greater degrees of anxiety, sadness, and self-consciousness are noted. The crucial elements appear to be the integration of the prosthesis into the body image and the concentration of attention on future function rather than on past loss(Emotional_and_Psychological_Reactions_to_Amputation [Accessed 24 Oct. 2021]).

Self-esteem

> Body image is a person's individual perception of his/her own body and is a multidimensional dynamic process and affected by internal factors such as age, sex, physical condition as well as external factors including social or environmental factors [10]. Body image disturbance is the result of social values emphasizing vitality and physical appearence and fitness. Therefore amputation may be seen as a sign of failure. Amputees have to adapt physically, socially, and psychologically to alterations in structure, function, and body image [11]. Data concerning body image in patients immediately after amputation is missing in the literature.

> Self-esteem is a positive or negative orientation toward oneself: an overall evaluation of one's worth or value [12], [13]. Self-esteem encompasses beliefs and emotions such as triumph, despair, pride and shame [14].
