Amputee Mental Health.

> Amputation presents multi-directional challenges. It affects function, sensation and body image. The psychological reactions vary greatly and depend on many factors and variable. In most cases, the predominant experience of the amputee is one of loss: not only the obvious loss of the limb but also resulting losses in function, self-image, career and relationships[1].

> Many of the psychological reactions may be transient, some are helpful and constructive, others less so, and a few may require further action (e.g. psychiatric assessment in the case of psychosis)[1].

> About ≥30% of amputees are troubled by depression[1][2]. Psychological morbidity, decreased self esteem, distorted body image, increased dependency and significant levels of social isolation are also observed in short and long-term follow up after amputation[3][4].(Emotional_and_Psychological_Reactions_to_Amputation [Accessed 24 Oct. 2021]).

Personality Style

> Individuals who are narcissistically invested in their physical appearance and power tend to react negatively to the loss of the limb. They see it as a major assault upon their dignity and self-worth. Conversely, dependent individuals may cherish the sick role and find in it welcome relief from pressure and responsibility[19].

> Those with a premorbid history of depression are more susceptible to dysphoria following amputation[24] The loss serves to crystallize notions of a basic defect, sometimes expressed in self-punishing behaviors[25].

> Timid and self-conscious individuals who are excessively concerned about their social standing are more likely to suffer psychologically from limb loss than are self-assured individuals[26].

> Unexpected reactions may arise from secondary gain. If disability results in improved financial or social status, psychological adjustment may be made easier, especially if those gains are not directly challenged[19].(Emotional_and_Psychological_Reactions_to_Amputation [Accessed 24 Oct. 2021]).

Fundamentals of Amputation Care and Prosthetics

MODERN PROSTHETIC TECHNOLOGY

> Technological explosion has accompanied the remarkable advances in
the philosophical care of those with amputations. Rudimentary suspension systems have given way to innovative suction based, individually constructed socket systems. These systems allow for decreased
pain, preservation of limb integrity, and functionality. Computer
technology has been applied to the fitting of socket systems as well
as to the successful replacement of missing joints. Computer assisted
knees have now become common technology, which allows for
better control, improved energy expenditure, and return to activities
prohibited by mechanical technology. The quest for a functional limb
has transformed to the quest for fully functioning bionic limbs.

Surgical Complications
> Those individuals who suffer pain, infection, and residual-limb revision tend to develop greater degrees of despair and withdrawal than those who do not.  A poorly performed amputation almost guarantees poor rehabilitation. While a well-performed amputation does not guarantee a successful rehabilitation outcome, it certainly makes successful rehabilitation more possible(Emotional_and_Psychological_Reactions_to_Amputation [Accessed 24 Oct. 2021]).

Prosthetic Rehabilitation
> The use of well-fitting prosthetic reduces pain and  post-amputation depression[5]. Conversely, if the prosthetic application is absent or delayed, greater degrees of anxiety, sadness, and self-consciousness are noted. The crucial elements appear to be the integration of the prosthesis into the body image and the concentration of attention on future function rather than on past loss(Emotional_and_Psychological_Reactions_to_Amputation [Accessed 24 Oct. 2021]).

Self-esteem

> Body image is a person's individual perception of his/her own body and is a multidimensional dynamic process and affected by internal factors such as age, sex, physical condition as well as external factors including social or environmental factors [10]. Body image disturbance is the result of social values emphasizing vitality and physical appearence and fitness. Therefore amputation may be seen as a sign of failure. Amputees have to adapt physically, socially, and psychologically to alterations in structure, function, and body image [11]. Data concerning body image in patients immediately after amputation is missing in the literature.

> Self-esteem is a positive or negative orientation toward oneself: an overall evaluation of one's worth or value [12], [13]. Self-esteem encompasses beliefs and emotions such as triumph, despair, pride and shame(Holzer et al., 2014).

Phantom Limb Pain
Steven D. Waldman MD, JD, in Pain Review, 2009

Signs and Symptoms
> The phantom limb pain may take multiple forms. It most often takes the form of dysesthetic pain. Additionally, the patient with phantom limb pain may experience abnormal kinesthetic sensation (i.e., the limb is in an abnormal position). The patient may also experience abnormal kinetic sensation (i.e., that the phantom limb is moving). It has been reported that many patients with phantom limb pain experience a telescoping phenomenon (i.e., that the proximal part of the absent limb is missing). When this occurs, that patient may report that the phantom foot feels like it is attached directly to the proximal thigh. Phantom limb pain may fade over time, with younger patients more likely to experience a diminution of phantom limb symptomatology. Due to the unusual nature of phantom limb sensation and pain, a behavioral component to the pain is invariably present(Steven D. Waldman MD, JD, in Pain Review, 2009).

> Lower limb amputation is a traumatic and life changing surgical procedure affecting an individual's functional, psychological and social aspects.1 The use of prosthesis following an amputation has a positive influence on an individual's psychosocial status and quality of life.

> Body image refers to the mental picture that a person forms of his or her body and its appearance. The body image is a reflection of prior experiences and the perception of current body diagram which is arranged in the sensory cortex of the cerebrum. Body image is affected by various factors such as optic and tactile senses, emotional experiences and the relative effects of these experiences on body image perception, the impressions of others about our physical appearance and our reactions to these impressions, and our attitudes and values regarding our own body when comparing it to others. An alteration in an individual's body image will set up a series of emotional, physiological and psychological reactions.

Body image perception, compliance with a prosthesis and cognitive performance in transfemoral amputees

> The loss of a limb by amputation affects body image perception dramatically. As the amputation level increases the discomfort of the amputee from his/her own image increases.4 The discomfort from body image affects negatively an amputees quality of life ((Gozaydinoglu, Hosbay and Durmaz, 2019).

Xie, J. and Lu, Y., 2021. A retrospective on lithium-ion batteries.

Full-cell Li-ion batteries

>Asahi Kasei Corporation assembled a full rechargeable battery combining the petroleum coke anode with Goodenough’s LiCoO2 cathode, which was later commercialized by Sony in 1990 (~80 Wh kg–1, 200 Wh L–1) (Fig. 1). The finding of Sanyo’s researchers6,15 and Dahn’s work16 with EC as co-solvent paved the way for the development of Li-ion batteries with a graphite anode and increased the voltage and energy density to 4.2 V and 400 Wh L–1 respectively. In 1993, Guyomard and Tarascon18 reported a new electrolyte formulation, LiPF6 in EC/DMC, for its improved oxidation stability (Fig. 1b). This electrolyte remains one of the popular electrolytes until today, affording LiCoO2-based Li-ion batteries three times higher energy density (250 Wh kg–1, 600 Wh L–1) than that of the first-generation devices by Sony.

Anode

>Lithium metal is the lightest metal and possesses a high specific capacity (3.86 Ah g−1) and an extremely low electrode potential (−3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode), rendering it an ideal anode material for high-voltage and high-energy batteries. However, the electrochemical potential of Li+/Li lies above the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of practically known non-aqueous electrolytes, leading to continuous electrolyte reduction unless a passivating solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is formed1. The SEI is susceptible to damage and repairs nonuniformly on the surface of lithium metal owing to the large volume change and high reactivity of lithium metal, leading to dendrite growth, which could cause cell to short-circuit and catch fire.

Power 

>Mechanical engineers at the University of Michigan have repurposed small motors originally designed for the International Space Station (ISS) into a high-tech prosthetic leg that mimics natural biomechanics. The bionic limb offers a more natural gait and is quiter than previous prosthetics. Like electric vehicles, the prosthetic limb charges the battery every time the it ‘hits the breaks’ — in this case, energy is captured every time the foot hits the ground. This enables users to almost double their walking time on a single charge per day.

>“Our prosthetic leg consumes approximately half the battery power of state-of-art robotic legs, yet can produce more force,” said Robert Gregg, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Michigan.

>“If the joints are stiff or rigid, the force is transferred to the residual limb, and that can be painful,” Gregg said. “Instead, we use that force to charge the battery.”

>One of the space station motors powers the knee while another powers the ankle. Unlike previous robotic prosthethics, this arrangement uses fewer gears, thereby greatly reducing the noise from the scale of a vacuum cleaner to a refrigerator.

>“We designed our joints to be as compliant, or flexible, as possible,” said Toby Elery of the University of Michigan and first author of the study. “Our robotic leg can perform and even react like a human joint would, enabling a naturally free-swinging knee and shock absorption when contacting the ground.” (Motors developed for space station drive self-charging prosthetic leg, 2021).


FLEX CELL BATTERIES

>FlexCell is not just another battery.  For size, shape, and function, FlexCells are engineered specifically to meet needs of upper-limb amputees.  It's a battery system that redefines powering prostheses.

Conforms to your needs

>Worry less about making spaces for batteries.  At less than 4mm thick and leveraging space-age fleixble battery technology, FlexCells can fit into tight spaces.  Making space for a battery during fabrication is now one less thing you have to worry about

Form and function

>Build a natural-looking and streamlined prosthesis shell.  Our low-profile design means no bulges for battery space.  Patients enjoy the look; prosthetists appreciate the ease of fabrication.

Effortless charging

>Make charging a breeze.  To charge,. snap the charger connector to the charging port - no need to struggle trying to plug a connector in.  If the cord is pulled, the magnetic connector comes right off.

Capacity for you

>Tailor the capacity to your needs.  FlexCells come in two different pack sizes and up to four packs can be combined in one system.  Combine four FlexCells for an all-day capacity of 2200 mAh or install two FlexCell Minis for the ultimate lightweight prosthesis.  For every case in between, there's a FlexCell system that's right for you.

Technical Specifications(FlexCell, 2021)

Materials:

Platinum silicone

>Made primarily of sand, food grade platinum silicone is flexible and durable. It’s also heat tolerant, so you can boil, bake, and cook in these products without danger of denaturing.

Plant Based Plastics


>Most prosthetic manufacturing companies use crude oils that are expensive and not
environmentally friendly. The use of natural materials is a more efficient alternative in creating
prosthetics today. Methods of producing a cost-effective, functional, and environmentally
friendly material involves utilizing polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) that is derived from biological
processes. Incorporating this biopolymer into prosthetics will be a step forward for the prosthetic
and plastic industries. By contacting a manufacturing company and proposing these alternative
methods, the extraction of hazardous crude oils, and the future cost of prosthetics could be
reduced.

"Along with this perspective shift comes the various leg designs that express the personality of the wearer" (Inc., 2021)

>I grew up in the 1950s & 60s. Before my leg was amputated at the age of 12, I had a brace & 7-inch platform shoe which stuck out like a sore thumb. Kids will pick on anything out of the ordinary, so I was teased a lot. All I ever wanted to do was look like everyone else. I’m too self-conscious to go out in public without a “natural” cover. I’ve had too many negative reactions over the years; I just don’t want to deal with it anymore.

Carol Southern on January 14, 2020 (Reviews, Inc., 2021)

>I am particularly concerned about curious young children . . . I want them to be comfortable and I encourage questions from them. As said, the human spirit is undaunted – I want people to know that.

The look of a prosthesis
is called ‘cosmesis’(www.limbs4life.org.au)

What are cosmetic covers?
Cosmetic covers sit over all the parts between the
socket and the end of the prosthesis (foot or hand).
For example, someone with a below-knee amputation
may have a cosmetic cover placed from the foot to the
knee area. 

"while the advancements in prosthetic limb technology have been huge, amputees have not had much choice when it comes to adapting a prosthesis to match their own style" (amplitude, 2021)
