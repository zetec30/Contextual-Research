Amputee Mental Health.

> Amputation presents multi-directional challenges. It affects function, sensation and body image. The psychological reactions vary greatly and depend on many factors and variable. In most cases, the predominant experience of the amputee is one of loss: not only the obvious loss of the limb but also resulting losses in function, self-image, career and relationships[1].

> Many of the psychological reactions may be transient, some are helpful and constructive, others less so, and a few may require further action (e.g. psychiatric assessment in the case of psychosis)[1].

> About â‰¥30% of amputees are troubled by depression[1][2]. Psychological morbidity, decreased self esteem, distorted body image, increased dependency and significant levels of social isolation are also observed in short and long-term follow up after amputation[3][4].(Emotional_and_Psychological_Reactions_to_Amputation [Accessed 24 Oct. 2021]).

Personality Style

> Individuals who are narcissistically invested in their physical appearance and power tend to react negatively to the loss of the limb. They see it as a major assault upon their dignity and self-worth. Conversely, dependent individuals may cherish the sick role and find in it welcome relief from pressure and responsibility[19].

> Those with a premorbid history of depression are more susceptible to dysphoria following amputation[24] The loss serves to crystallize notions of a basic defect, sometimes expressed in self-punishing behaviors[25].

> Timid and self-conscious individuals who are excessively concerned about their social standing are more likely to suffer psychologically from limb loss than are self-assured individuals[26].

> Unexpected reactions may arise from secondary gain. If disability results in improved financial or social status, psychological adjustment may be made easier, especially if those gains are not directly challenged[19].(Emotional_and_Psychological_Reactions_to_Amputation [Accessed 24 Oct. 2021]).
