Amputee Mental Health.

> Amputation presents multi-directional challenges. It affects function, sensation and body image. The psychological reactions vary greatly and depend on many factors and variable. In most cases, the predominant experience of the amputee is one of loss: not only the obvious loss of the limb but also resulting losses in function, self-image, career and relationships[1].

> Many of the psychological reactions may be transient, some are helpful and constructive, others less so, and a few may require further action (e.g. psychiatric assessment in the case of psychosis)[1].

> About â‰¥30% of amputees are troubled by depression[1][2]. Psychological morbidity, decreased self esteem, distorted body image, increased dependency and significant levels of social isolation are also observed in short and long-term follow up after amputation[3][4].(Emotional_and_Psychological_Reactions_to_Amputation [Accessed 24 Oct. 2021]).

Personality Style

> Individuals who are narcissistically invested in their physical appearance and power tend to react negatively to the loss of the limb. They see it as a major assault upon their dignity and self-worth. Conversely, dependent individuals may cherish the sick role and find in it welcome relief from pressure and responsibility[19].

> Those with a premorbid history of depression are more susceptible to dysphoria following amputation[24] The loss serves to crystallize notions of a basic defect, sometimes expressed in self-punishing behaviors[25].

> Timid and self-conscious individuals who are excessively concerned about their social standing are more likely to suffer psychologically from limb loss than are self-assured individuals[26].

> Unexpected reactions may arise from secondary gain. If disability results in improved financial or social status, psychological adjustment may be made easier, especially if those gains are not directly challenged[19].(Emotional_and_Psychological_Reactions_to_Amputation [Accessed 24 Oct. 2021]).

Fundamentals of Amputation Care and Prosthetics

MODERN PROSTHETIC TECHNOLOGY

> Technological explosion has accompanied the remarkable advances in
the philosophical care of those with amputations. Rudimentary suspension systems have given way to innovative suction based, individually constructed socket systems. These systems allow for decreased
pain, preservation of limb integrity, and functionality. Computer
technology has been applied to the fitting of socket systems as well
as to the successful replacement of missing joints. Computer assisted
knees have now become common technology, which allows for
better control, improved energy expenditure, and return to activities
prohibited by mechanical technology. The quest for a functional limb
has transformed to the quest for fully functioning bionic limbs.

Surgical Complications
> Those individuals who suffer pain, infection, and residual-limb revision tend to develop greater degrees of despair and withdrawal than those who do not.  A poorly performed amputation almost guarantees poor rehabilitation. While a well-performed amputation does not guarantee a successful rehabilitation outcome, it certainly makes successful rehabilitation more possible(Emotional_and_Psychological_Reactions_to_Amputation [Accessed 24 Oct. 2021]).

Prosthetic Rehabilitation
> The use of well-fitting prosthetic reduces pain and  post-amputation depression[5]. Conversely, if the prosthetic application is absent or delayed, greater degrees of anxiety, sadness, and self-consciousness are noted. The crucial elements appear to be the integration of the prosthesis into the body image and the concentration of attention on future function rather than on past loss(Emotional_and_Psychological_Reactions_to_Amputation [Accessed 24 Oct. 2021]).

Self-esteem

> Body image is a person's individual perception of his/her own body and is a multidimensional dynamic process and affected by internal factors such as age, sex, physical condition as well as external factors including social or environmental factors [10]. Body image disturbance is the result of social values emphasizing vitality and physical appearence and fitness. Therefore amputation may be seen as a sign of failure. Amputees have to adapt physically, socially, and psychologically to alterations in structure, function, and body image [11]. Data concerning body image in patients immediately after amputation is missing in the literature.

> Self-esteem is a positive or negative orientation toward oneself: an overall evaluation of one's worth or value [12], [13]. Self-esteem encompasses beliefs and emotions such as triumph, despair, pride and shame(Holzer et al., 2014).

Phantom Limb Pain
Steven D. Waldman MD, JD, in Pain Review, 2009

Signs and Symptoms
> The phantom limb pain may take multiple forms. It most often takes the form of dysesthetic pain. Additionally, the patient with phantom limb pain may experience abnormal kinesthetic sensation (i.e., the limb is in an abnormal position). The patient may also experience abnormal kinetic sensation (i.e., that the phantom limb is moving). It has been reported that many patients with phantom limb pain experience a telescoping phenomenon (i.e., that the proximal part of the absent limb is missing). When this occurs, that patient may report that the phantom foot feels like it is attached directly to the proximal thigh. Phantom limb pain may fade over time, with younger patients more likely to experience a diminution of phantom limb symptomatology. Due to the unusual nature of phantom limb sensation and pain, a behavioral component to the pain is invariably present(Steven D. Waldman MD, JD, in Pain Review, 2009).

> Lower limb amputation is a traumatic and life changing surgical procedure affecting an individual's functional, psychological and social aspects.1 The use of prosthesis following an amputation has a positive influence on an individual's psychosocial status and quality of life.

> Body image refers to the mental picture that a person forms of his or her body and its appearance. The body image is a reflection of prior experiences and the perception of current body diagram which is arranged in the sensory cortex of the cerebrum. Body image is affected by various factors such as optic and tactile senses, emotional experiences and the relative effects of these experiences on body image perception, the impressions of others about our physical appearance and our reactions to these impressions, and our attitudes and values regarding our own body when comparing it to others. An alteration in an individual's body image will set up a series of emotional, physiological and psychological reactions.

Body image perception, compliance with a prosthesis and cognitive performance in transfemoral amputees

> The loss of a limb by amputation affects body image perception dramatically. As the amputation level increases the discomfort of the amputee from his/her own image increases.4 The discomfort from body image affects negatively an amputees quality of life ((Gozaydinoglu, Hosbay and Durmaz, 2019).
