> Amputation presents multi-directional challenges. It affects function, sensation and body image. The psychological reactions vary greatly and depend on many factors and variable. In most cases, the predominant experience of the amputee is one of loss: not only the obvious loss of the limb but also resulting losses in function, self-image, career and relationships[1].

> Many of the psychological reactions may be transient, some are helpful and constructive, others less so, and a few may require further action (e.g. psychiatric assessment in the case of psychosis)[1].

> About â‰¥30% of amputees are troubled by depression[1][2]. Psychological morbidity, decreased self esteem, distorted body image, increased dependency and significant levels of social isolation are also observed in short and long-term follow up after amputation[3][4].(Emotional_and_Psychological_Reactions_to_Amputation [Accessed 24 Oct. 2021]).
