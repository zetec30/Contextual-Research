#Response to – A fish can’t judge the water.

In reference to “Do we use software to think?”.   The answer to this from my own opinion is yes, we do use software to think.    I’m writing this discussion in word and every now and then I spell check to help me think if I’ve spelt something right.
We search the internet looking for ideas on purchases for say Christmas or birthdays.   So, websites are helping us decide what to buy or targeted ads based on search results. We have information implanted to us, so we do think more.
My physiotherapist used the following analogy to explain how humans use tools to negotiate the space around their bodies:
The idea is interesting with human input and senses being inputted against a post human cyborg.
These implying robots work with human input to start with, they learn from us, there is no post human robot without human input like machine learning software.   A cyborg can feel and express emotion if software is told to do this by a human.
It has become our natural habitat.

Seems everything we use is in some form relying on code in the background this can be washing machines, dryers, cars, computers, Prosthetics, telescopes, and phones just to name a few.

I think the literature points out some interesting facts based around software and its good vs evil uses. “Software isn’t politically neutral” this is true but the person writing code might be.

There is risk associated with all this code being connected to the household via networks, the article is saying anti-piracy laws are not applying to my kitchen, but hackers could be more interested especially in connective cameras or home PC’s.

Moreover, software has evolved and become so enhanced it is used to run complete companies, banks, and Government systems. The military use code in automated weapons also. We rely on software for everyday life from going to bed setting an alarm with Alexa. 
Most sleep with a smart watch on that records sleep patterns to software and in turn to a database.    We use our phones to remind us of events or to calculate sums or even predict our text, is this making us smarter or making databases bigger and software smarter.
A good argument is being raised in the article about open-source code, problem with open source is many people use it and many,  can access the full security of the code and then modify it to their needs.

I like the way the end apart uses part words I believe this is to prove that the brain is a great tool and can make words out even if they are jumbled and incomplete.
