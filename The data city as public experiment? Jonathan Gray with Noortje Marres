First off I notice the words city as a Machine for living in brackets, weird. Never heard this saying before. But the more you read the more you understand whats being said .
So cities present and oldare being tailored to humans via technology, obviosuly the present being more advanced, cities are tailored to use more and more every day with the likes of smart motorways, smart cars, smart phones, smart watches.
Cameras, Sensors, tracking technology just to name some. I guess even wifi being available pretty much anywhere you go too.

I can see that data plays a big part in modern lives and how the data is used to offer indiviual expieriences city by city such as tailoring street lighting to specific areas that suggest the light is needed longer, whether its darker in these areas or ridden with crime.

Thinking that everything we do on a daily basis is captured and the data used to improve the next technology upgrades to cities. The thing is, is this data all good or some not so good and used to invade our pricacy.

Everything we do captures data, get on a train (how many people), ages, gender, A to Z. Uber cars data mapping your route to and from and again personal details used via the Uber app to pay for the service your age, gender, addresse, phone number and phone type all gathered in big data.

All this data increases at lightning speeds and contributed mostly to better bigger products when no used to track you or compare you against other data.

The data collected in daily life is experimentation on us also, watching us follow digital signs (sheep effect) do we do as we are told. what are our beliefs?
who's our friends.
