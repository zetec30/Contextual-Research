Fotoforensics: allows a user to upload an image outputting the software and version that created it. I had to try this out!. Uploaded an image I was curious about and the feedback was glitched.
I proceeded to click on games in the left hand side panel that turned my image into a puzzle game, many pieces that you move to put back together.
I had skipped digest so tried this next witht he below.

I see binary numbers above which I'm guessing is the digital make up of the image.

I wont add strings as this was rather long but what an eye opener to the ammount of data in one image.

I have to admit this has a edward Snowden feel to it, the american whistle blower.

So cloaking it appears is an attempt by an image producer to wipe data from the image. This makes Fotoforensics void although it can tell you the data has been wiped this gives suspicion of covert operations or foul play.
The article mentions russian foul play more than anything from what I'm reading. I'm also getting a feeling the article mentions studying and wrong doing and how research can be flagged by agencies as wrogdoing.
More I read these pages the more I see it's all about being annomynous and how everything you do online or even with cameras can create a foot print tracing back to you. Many tech users are using do not track options when browsing the web.
Some activists have turned to grafiti to give political messages so they can not be traced online or digitally.

So ending this part of the article fotoforensics is evidence collected from digital activity.
